The Xazna AI API employs token-based authentication. A valid API token must be included in all requests to both the text to speech and speech to text endpoints.

## Getting a Token

1. Go to [ai.xazna.uz](https://ai.xazna.uz).
2. Sign in using your Xazna AI account details.
3. Access the API section to create or retrieve your API token.
4. Keep the token secure and private.

<Callout type="warning">
  Avoid sharing your API token publicly. If it's compromised, regenerate it at
  [ai.xazna.uz](https://ai.xazna.uz).
